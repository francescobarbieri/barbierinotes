## Göllmann Agency
<Small>IT Manager, 2022 - Current</Small>
As an IT Manager, I bring hands-on experience to a broad range of IT projects, including developing high-quality, hand-coded websites for Italian companies. I collaborated with designers to craft responsive frontends using HTML/CSS, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, while building robust backend logic with PHP, SQL, Google Cloud Platform, and Firebase ensuring scalability, performance, and SEO optimization.

Being behind all IT operations, I take full accountability for delivering reliable, company-wide solutions that align with clients strategic goals.
