In 2025 we're probably witnessing a new industrial revolution thanks to Artificial Intelligence and what's making this possible are datacenters. I decided to have a deep dive into them.

In fact, power often constitutes the largest operating cost for a data center, as electricity is required to run a data center’s servers, cooling systems, storage systems, networking equipment, backup systems, security systems, and lighting.  While power requirements for a data center can vary significantly depending on the facility’s scale and design, the largest data centers can range from 100,000 square feet to several millions of square feet and can demand anywhere from 20 to over 100 MW of power.

This magnitude of required power presents a host of challenges related to grid capacity and transmission infrastructure.
